### Bio

Hey, I'm Hesam, a dedicated 19-year-old front-end enthusiast deeply passionate about web development. My coding journey began at the age of 16, where I took my first steps into the world of programming. Since then, I've been on a continuous exploration, tackling projects ranging from compact web applications to expansive front-end systems.

What fuels my drive in web development is the exhilarating challenge of solving intricate problems and crafting innovative solutions. The dynamic nature of front-end work keeps me engaged, offering constant opportunities for learning and growth. Whether it's mastering a new framework or experimenting with cutting-edge tools, I'm always eager to expand my skills.
